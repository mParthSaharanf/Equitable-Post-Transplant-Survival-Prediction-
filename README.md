# Equitable-Post-Transplant-Survival-Prediction-

This project addresses the critical challenge of predicting post-transplant survival outcomes following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT). By implementing multiple machine learning approaches, we aim to develop models that not only achieve high predictive accuracy but also maintain equitable performance across different racial groups. This is particularly important in healthcare settings where algorithmic bias can perpetuate or exacerbate existing health disparities.
